-- Extract metrics from a `GameState`

-- number of pieces that can be taken
-- number of non-pawn pieces on the board
-- number of pawns
-- number of checks
-- number of moves by piece
-- number of moves by advanced pawns (5th rank or above)
-- how asymmetric is the pawn structure?

-- We can use these metrics to define tactical positions
